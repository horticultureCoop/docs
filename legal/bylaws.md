# Article II Membership

Section 2.1 – **Eligibility and admission.**   Membership in the Co-op shall be voluntary and open to any organization or individual either with an interest or active engagement in sustainable product development or design services, whose apparent purpose is to take part in original Co-op projects and to join with other members to serve clients.  Applicants for full membership will be admitted upon submitting required information, demonstrating the advanced nature of their product design and/or development record, and complying with the share purchase or barter requirement.  A specification for what determines full membership eligability shall be determined and maintained over time by the board.  There shall be provisions not only for full standard members, but also associate members who have an interest in membership but who do not meet the full membership requirement of advanced design and/or development record.  There shall also be a special advisor membership tier for which there is no share purchase or barter requirement, but an implicit board-determined requirement of some pertinent skill or experience which would help advance the Co-op's mission.  All member classes shall be eligible for board seat nomination.  On or before admission to membership, each member shall be provided a copy of these bylaws.  If within six months after the date of application any doubts arise concerning eligibility the application for membership shall be subject to approval by the Board.

Section 2.2 – **Share purchase or barter requirement.**   Full and Associate Members shall be required to purchase, or offer barter in exchange for, a share at an issuing price or value determined by the Board of Directors.

Section 2.3 – **Rights.**   Each member shall be entitled to gainfully take part in client projects sourced through the Co-op on terms generally available to members, and to participate in the governance of the Co-op as set forth in these bylaws.

Section 2.4 – **Access to information.**   Members shall be provided adequate and timely information as to the organizational and financial affairs of the Co-op.  A member shall be provided specific information concerning the affairs of the Co-op upon request that is made in good faith and for a proper purpose, subject to reasonable restrictions prescribed by the Board of Directors.  To protect the privacy of members any proper request necessitating information from the Co-op&#39;s records of members shall whenever possible be accommodated by means other than direct access to such records.

Section 2.5 – **Inactive status.**   A member who becomes delinquent in meeting the share purchase or barter requirement for a period of one year shall be placed into inactive status.  His or her participation rights shall then be suspended.  A member in inactive status may attain good standing upon recommencing payment of financial obligations or reestablishing a barter relationship with the Co-op.  References in these bylaws to the rights and entitlements of members shall be understood to refer only to members in good standing.

Section 2.6 – **Settlement of disputes.**  In any dispute between the Co-op and any of its members or former members which cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, it shall be the policy of the Co-op to prefer the use of mediation whereby an impartial mediator may facilitate negotiations between the parties and assist them in developing a mutually acceptable settlement.  No party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith.

Section 2.7 – **Limited transferability.**   Upon termination of membership, the Co-op will transfer the carrying value of share credits and retained patronage dividends, net of any authorized offsets, to the credit of a designated person, provided that the transfer involves no element of profit and the transferee is or becomes a member of the Co-op.  Such a transfer shall be made upon the request and designation of the primary member or, if the primary member has died,  or is unavailable, upon request and designation of an appropriate person.  If such a transfer is later determined to have been improper, the Co-op shall reverse and/or correct such action.  Membership rights and interests may not otherwise be sold, assigned, or transferred.

Section 2.8 – **Termination.**   Membership may be terminated voluntarily by a member at any time upon notice to the Co-op, provided obligations have been met for participation in Co-op projects or business partnership arrangements with other members which originated from the Co-op.  Membership may be terminated involuntarily only for cause by the Board, provided the accused member is first accorded an adequate opportunity to respond to the charges in person or in writing.  Upon termination of membership, all rights and interests in the Co-op shall cease except for rights to redemption of capital pursuant to Articles VII and VIII of these bylaws.

# Article III Meetings of Members

Section 3.1 – **Annual Meeting.**   An annual meeting of members shall be held to receive reports on operations and finances, and to conduct such other business as may properly come before the meeting.  The Board may authorize the annual meeting to occur either in person or remotely via electronic means.

Section 3.2 – **Special meetings.**   Special meetings of members, including special votes of members by electronic balloting, may be called by the Board and shall be called by the Secretary as soon as practicable upon receipt of petitions authorized by not less than ten percent of all members in good standing, such petitions stating any proper business to be brought before members.

Section 3.3 – **Notices.**   Written notice of a meeting or vote of members, including such information as is required by law or by these bylaws, shall be delivered electronically to each member not less than seven days nor more than thirty days before the date for return of ballots or the date of the meeting.

Section 3.4 – **Record dates.**   Unless otherwise determined by the Board, only persons who are members at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of distribution of notices shall be entitled to receive such notice and to vote as a member.

Section 3.5 – **Quorum and voting.**   Those members present at any annual meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purposes of these Bylaws. In the case of balloting by mail or by electronic ballot, a quorum shall not be required for the vote to be effective. Voting by proxy shall not be permitted.  Unless otherwise required by law or by these by–laws, issues shall be decided by a simple majority of votes cast except where one or more choices are to be made from several alternatives, in which case the alternative(s) receiving the most votes shall be considered approved.  To prevent a tie an instant runoff system will be used. Voters will have the option to vote preferentially by indicating first, second, third choices and so on.  If two options or candidates are tied for first place, then second choice votes which had been awarded to non–first place finishing options or candidates, will be counted to break the tie.

Section 3.6 – **Balloting.**   The Board may authorize balloting electronically on any issue that may properly be brought before members. Except as otherwise required by law or these bylaws, electronic balloting may be used in conjunction with or in lieu of a meeting of members. When electronic balloting is used, the notice shall include a copy of the issue or issues to be voted upon, together with a notification of the date by which ballots must be returned. If electronic balloting is used in conjunction with a meeting of members, votes cast by electronic ballot shall be counted together with votes cast in person at the meeting. A vote cast by electronic ballot shall be equivalent for all purposes to a vote cast in person by the member at a meeting of members.

Section 3.7 – **In-person meetings.**  The date, time and place of an in–person meeting of members shall be determined by the Board or, in the event that the Board fails to so act, by the Secretary, and such information shall be included in the notice of the meeting.

In–person meetings of members shall be conducted generally in accordance with reasonable rules of procedure.

Section 3.8 – **Issues submitted by members.**   Notices of a vote or meeting of members shall include any proper issue submitted by petition of not less than five percent of all members in good standing.  Petitions must be received electronically by the Secretary not less than thirty days before the scheduled distribution of notices.

# Article IV Board of Directors

Section 4.1 – **Powers and duties.**   Except as to matters reserved to members by law or by these bylaws, the corporate powers of the Co-op shall be exercised by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, and the business and affairs of the Co-op shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors (sometimes referred to in these bylaws as &quot;the Board&quot;).

Terms of directors shall be so staggered that one–third of the terms, or as nearly so as may be practicable, shall expire in each year. Directors shall be elected for terms of three years. To facilitate staggering of terms, some directors may periodically be elected for one or two year terms. Directors shall hold office until their successors are elected or until their terms are terminated sooner in accordance with these bylaws. If the Board of Directors election is uncontested, the Board of Directors will bring the candidate slate to the annual meeting and members will vote by a show of hands. The members that are attending the annual meeting will constitute the meeting quorum. There will be no nominations from the floor.  The vote for the candidate slate will be final and binding.

Section 4.4 – **Compensation of directors.**   Directors shall receive profits interest stipends of $1,000 annually unless the Co-op funds are insufficient, in which case Directors recieve a stipend calculated by evenly dividing annual profit. Officers shall receive additional stipends of $500 annually.  The foregoing stipends may be increased by vote of members.

Section 4.5 – **Standards of conduct.**   Directors shall be responsible at all times for discharging their duties in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner that they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Co-op.  The Co-op may not lend money to, or guarantee the obligation of, a director.

Section 4.6 – **Conflicts of interest.**   Directors shall be under an affirmative duty to disclose their actual or potential conflicts of interest in any matter under consideration by the Board or by a committee exercising authority of the board, and such interest shall be made a matter of record in the minutes of the meeting.  Directors having such an interest may not participate in the decision of the matter nor in deliberations leading to such decision.  A transaction in which a director has an interest may be approved only by a majority of directors who have no interest in the transaction and upon a determination that the transaction is fair to the Co-op.

Section 4.7 – **Committees.**   The Board may appoint special or standing committees to advise the Board or to exercise such authority as the Board shall designate.  Advisory committees shall include at least one director.  Committees exercising any authority of the Board shall consist only of directors and shall conform to all procedural requirements applicable to the Board.

Section 4.8 – **Indemnification.**   Subject to limitations in Minnesota law and in the Co-op&#39;s Articles of Incorporation, the Co-op shall as required and may as permitted indemnify its current and former directors and officers against all reasonable claims to which they may become subject by reason of their positions with the Co-op or their service in its behalf. This right to indemnity shall include reimbursement of all of the Director&#39;s or Officer&#39;s reasonable costs of defense including attorneys fees. Indemnification payments and advances of expenses shall be made on a priority basis but only in such increments and at such times as will not jeopardize the ability of the Co-op to pay its ordinary and necessary obligations as they become due.  All such payments made shall be reported in writing to members with or before the notice of the next scheduled vote or meeting of members.

Section 4.9 – **Termination.**   The term of office of a director may be terminated prior to its expiration in any of the following ways: (i) voluntarily by a director upon notice to the Co-op; (ii) automatically upon termination of membership in the Co-op; (iii) for cause, by vote of two–thirds of all directors in office voting in person or a majority vote of the members at a meeting as specified in Section 3.  Removal under (iii) shall require that the reasons or charges be stated in a written notice of the meeting and that the affected director be provided the opportunity to answer the reasons or charges in person and/or in writing. A director who is absent from two consecutive Board meetings, or three meetings in a term year, unless excused by the Board for good cause, shall be presumed to have resigned.

Section 4.10 – **Vacancies**. Whenever a vacancy among directors occurs before a term of office has been completed, the board may appoint a director to fill the vacancy.  Such director or directors shall serve until the next regularly scheduled election of directors, when a candidate will be elected for the remainder of the term that would have been served by the vacated director.  At any such election, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes will be elected to available three–year terms.  After those are filled, the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes will be elected to the shorter term.

Section 5.4 – **Quorum.**   The presence in person of a majority of directors then in office shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board.

Section 5.6 – **Action without a meeting.**   Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board may be taken without a meeting if a written consent to the action is signed by all directors and filed with the minutes of meetings.  Such consents may be executed by e–mail.  Any action without a meeting shall be read into the minutes of the next meeting of the board.

Section 5.7 – **Open meetings.** Meetings of the Board and all committees shall be open to members.  Sessions of a meeting may be closed only as to issues of a particularly sensitive nature.  Action at a closed session shall be read into the minutes of meetings at the first opportunity which would not compromise the sensitivity of the matters at issue.
